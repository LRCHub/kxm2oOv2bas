[00:00.02] I don't know where I went wrong
[00:08.16] Tell me, should I see someone?
[00:20.13] Ceiling's falling down on me
[00:30.26] You look but you never see
[00:43.26] 
[00:43.10] Just take it out on me
[00:48.09] It's easier than saying what you mean
[00:55.35] Test me, see if I break
[01:05.18] Tell me this time you've changed
[01:13.80] I'll take it out on you
[01:19.85] It's easier than talking it through
[01:27.34] Test me, see if I stay
[01:36.64] How could I walk the other way?
