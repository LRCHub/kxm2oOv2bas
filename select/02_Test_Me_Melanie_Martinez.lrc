[00:04.58] Ha, ha!
[00:07.79] Wooh!
[00:10.29] 
[00:21.39] Hey God, I'll be the jester
[00:25.79] Entertain ya to the best of my ability
[00:31.82] When I suffer more, fragility, when I answer
[00:37.24] Pay me for a reason, oh-oh
[00:40.29] So stop complaining, I'll have our seasons, oh-oh
[00:45.35] It's not just a joke or a lesson to live through
[00:49.74] Every which way and second there's a breakthrough
[01:14.24] 
[00:53.40] I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
[00:56.79] Defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
[01:01.42] So I'd rather be tested by goddesses
[01:05.18] Resting their heads upon pillows
[01:08.15] Of all they have learned
[01:20.15] 
[01:11.02] I'm not to be forgottеn
[01:15.01] Trap your books when I walk in
[01:19.42] Magic talks without talking
[01:23.29] I'll make the most bеfore the coffin
[01:27.07] Born to be desired, oh-oh
[01:30.15] Gotta learn, yeah, eyes are always on the next score
[01:35.04] But space isn't there to always be filled up
[01:38.71] It's the quiet, the downtime to breathe in my lungs
[02:04.21] 
[01:42.85] 'Cause I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
[01:46.40] Defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
[01:51.18] So I beg to be tested by goddesses
[01:54.86] Resting their heads upon pillows
[01:57.88] Of all they have learned
[02:09.88] 
[01:59.44] 'Cause I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
[02:03.18] Test me, I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
[02:07.62] And I beg to be tested by goddesses
[02:11.35] Resting their heads upon pillows
[02:14.56] Of all they have learned
[02:26.56] 
[02:16.01] 'Cause I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
[02:19.55] Defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
[02:24.25] And I beg to be tested by goddesses
[02:27.83] Resting their heads upon pillows
[02:30.98] Of all they have learned
[02:42.98] 
[02:32.54] 'Cause I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
[02:33.49] (Give me an A+ if I'm doing this thing right)
[02:36.32] Defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
[02:40.84] And I'd rather be tested by goddesses
[02:44.48] Resting their heads upon pillows
[02:47.55] Of all they have learned
