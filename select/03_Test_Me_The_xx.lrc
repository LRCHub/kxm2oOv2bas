[00:00.23] I don't know where I went wrong
[00:09.99] Tell me, should I see someone?
[00:20.18] Ceiling's falling down on me
[00:29.87] You look but you never see
[00:42.87] 
[00:42.95] Just take it out on me
[00:47.60] It's easier than saying what you mean
[00:55.83] Test me, see if I break
[01:04.94] Tell me this time you've changed
[01:14.97] I'll take it out on you
[01:19.89] It's easier than talking it through
[01:28.08] Test me, see if I stay
[01:36.90] How could I walk the other way?
