[00:02.44] I'm sorry if I'm being way too honest.
[00:04.94] I'm tired of living on a broken promise.
[00:07.49] Since everything I do seems to come right back at me.
[00:12.89] Don't tell me what is right or what is wrong.
[00:15.75] When you don't even listen to my songs.
[00:18.55] Think you'll use my innocence against me.
[00:21.01] Don't you stress me.
[00:31.01] 
[00:22.73] Why you getting mad at my opinion?
[00:26.46] Seems like you are blinded to my vision.
[00:29.25] But you don't really care 'bout what I'm feelin'.
[00:31.55] Never listen no.
[00:39.55] 
[00:34.80] Tonight, don't test me, don't test me
[00:39.76] My mind ain't ready, ain't ready
[00:45.80] I don't wanna fight no more, I'm over giving up my soul
[00:51.19] Tonight, don't test me, don't test me
[01:09.69] 
[00:56.36] You like to put me down to feed your ego.
[00:59.08] You say that I should listen to what you know.
[01:01.67] And if I don't agree it don't matter.
[01:04.42] All of my beliefs, they don't matter, no
[01:24.42] 
[01:07.12] Why you getting mad at my opinion?
[01:09.77] Seems like you are blinded to my vision.
[01:12.76] But you don't really care 'bout what I'm feelin'.
[01:15.04] Never listen no.
[01:23.04] 
[01:17.76] Tonight, don't test me, don't test me
[01:22.91] My mind ain't ready, ain't ready
[01:28.86] I don't wanna fight no more, I'm over giving up my soul
[01:34.08] Tonight, don't test me, don't test me
[01:52.58] 
[01:40.06] Who are you lie like that.
[01:42.25] Who are you to act like that.
[01:44.73] Who are you to judge like that.
[01:47.24] Who are you, who are you, who are you, who?
[01:50.60] Who are you lie like that (Like that)
[01:53.48] Who are you to act like that.
[01:55.44] Who are you to judge like that.
[01:58.39] Who are you, who are you, who are you?
[02:17.39] 
[02:01.23] Tonight, don't test me, don't test me
[02:19.73] 
[02:06.38] Tonight, don't test me, don't test me
[02:11.61] My mind ain't ready, ain't ready (No)
[02:17.67] I don't wanna fight no more, I'm over giving up my soul
[02:22.55] Tonight, don't test me, don't test me
